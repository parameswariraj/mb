<h1>Microbiology</h1>
<p class="font">Microbiology is a branch of biology that deals with the microorganisms.It is the study of microorganisms, or microbes, a diverse group of generally 
minute simple life-forms that include bacteria, archaea, algae, fungi, protozoa, and viruses. The field is concerned with the structure, function, and 
classification of such organisms and with ways of both exploiting and controlling their activities.
The 17th-century discovery of living forms existing invisible to the naked eye was a significant milestone in the history of science, for from the 13th century onward it had been postulated that “invisible” entities were responsible for decay and disease. The word microbe was coined in the last quarter of the 19th century to describe these organisms, all of which were thought to be related. 
As microbiology eventually developed into a specialized science, it was found that microbes are a very large group of extremely diverse organisms.</p>
<h1 class="h2">Types of microorganisms</h1><p class="font">The major groups of microorganisms—namely bacteria, archaea, fungi (yeasts and molds), algae, protozoa, and viruses</p>
<h1>Bacteria (eubacteria and archaea)</h1>
<p class="font"><a class="a"href="https://cdn.britannica.com/66/6166-050-27423137/drawing-structure-cell-bacillus-type.jpg">Bacteria</a> have a variety of
 <a class="a"href="https://microbeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bacteria_shapes-1024x363.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb2">shapes</a> including cocci, rods, and spirals. Individual cells generally range in width from 0.5 to 5 micrometres (μm; millionths of a metre). Although unicellular, bacteria often appear in pairs, chains, tetrads (groups of four), or clusters. Some have flagella, external whiplike structures that propel the organism through liquid media; some have capsule, an external coating of the cell; some produce spores—reproductive bodies that function much as seeds do among plants. One of the major characteristics of bacteria is their reaction to the Gram stain. Depending upon the chemical and structural composition of the cell wall, 
some bacteria are gram-positive, taking on the stain’s purple colour, whereas others are gram-negative.</p>
<h1>Fungi</h1>
<p class="font"><a class="a"href=""></a>Fungi can be single celled or very complex multicellular organisms. They are found in just about any habitat but most live on the 
land, mainly in soil or on plant material rather than in sea or fresh water. A group called the decomposers grow in the soil or on dead plant matter where they play 
an important role in the cycling of carbon and other elements. Some are parasites of plants causing diseases such as mildews, rusts, scabs or canker. In crops fungal
 diseases can lead to significant monetary loss for the farmer. A very small number of fungi cause diseases in animals. In humans these include skin diseases such as 
athletes’ foot, ringworm and thrush.</p>
<h2 class="h2">The three major groups of fungi are:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Multicellular filamentous moulds.</li>
<li>Macroscopic filamentous fungi that form large fruiting bodies. Sometimes the group is referred  to as ‘mushrooms’, but the mushroom is just the part of the 
fungus we see above ground which is also known as the fruiting body.</li>
<li>Single celled microscopic yeasts.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Viruses</h1>
<p class="font"><a class="a"href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dtpgi0zck/image/upload/s--7UXxoGoz--/c_fill,h_580,w_860/v1/EducationHub/photos/virus.webp">Viruses </a>are the smallest of all the microbes. They are said to be so small that 500 million rhinoviruses (which cause the common cold) could fit on to the head of a pin. 
They are unique because they are only alive and able to multiply inside the cells of other living things. The cell they multiply in is called the host cell.
A virus is made up of a core of genetic material, either DNA or RNA, surrounded by a protective coat called a capsid which is made up of protein. Sometimes the capsid is surrounded by an additional spikey coat called the envelope. Viruses are capable of latching onto host cells and getting inside them.
